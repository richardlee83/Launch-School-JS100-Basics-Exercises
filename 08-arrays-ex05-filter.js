/*
  Filter

  Count the number of elements in scores that are 100 or above.

  let scores = [96, 47, 113, 89, 100, 102];
*/

let scores = [96, 47, 113, 89, 100, 102];
let count = scores.filter(score => score >= 100).length;
console.log(count);   // 3

/*
  Solution:
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < scores.length; i += 1) {
    if (scores[i] >= 100) {
      count += 1;
    }
  }

  console.log(count); // 3


  Discussion:
  - Our solution makes use of a counter variable, that we initialize as 0. 
  - We then iterate over all elements in the scores array, and for each element 
    that is greater than or equal to 100, we increase the counter by 1.
