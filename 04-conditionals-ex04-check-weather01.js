/*
  Check the Weather, Part 1

  Initialize a variable weather with a string value being "sunny", "rainy", 
  or anything else.

  Write an if statement that logs:

  "It's a beautiful day!" if weather is assigned to the string "sunny",
  "Grab your umbrella." if weather is assigned to the string "rainy", and
  "Let's stay inside." otherwise.
  Test your code with different values for weather.
*/

let weather = 'sunny';

if (weather === 'sunny') {
  console.log(`It's a beautiful day!`);
} else if (weather === 'rainy') {
  console.log('Grab your umbrella.');
} else {
  console.log(`Let's stay inside.`);
}


/*
  Solution
  let weather = 'snow storm'; // 'sunny', 'rainy', ...

  if (weather === 'sunny') {
    console.log("It's a beautiful day!");
  } else if (weather === 'rainy') {
    console.log('Grab your umbrella.');
  } else {
    console.log("Let's stay inside.");
  }


  Discussion:
  - Note that we used the strict equality operator, ===, to determine 
    if weather was 'sunny' or 'rainy'. 
  - If both of these comparisons return false, the else branch of our if 
    statement will be executed.
