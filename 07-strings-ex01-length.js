/*
  Length

  Determine the length of the string:
  "These aren't the droids you're looking for.".
*/


console.log(`These aren't the droids you're looking for.`.length)
// 43

/*
  Solution:
  let string = "These aren't the droids you're looking for.";

  string.length; // 43


  Discussion:
  We can determine the length of a string using the length property. 

  An empty string will have a length of 0.
