/*
  Find the MDN documentation on operator precedence, and use it to find out
  which result the expression 4 * 5 + 3 ** 2 / 10 evaluates to.
*/


/*
  Answer:
  - Operator Precedence in Javascript for above example, from greatest to least:
    **          exponents
    * and /     multiplication and division
    +           addition
*/

console.log(4 * 5 + 3 ** 2 / 10);         // 20.9
console.log((4 * 5) + ((3 ** 2) / 10));   // 20.9


/*
  Solution:
  - The MDN page on operator precedence in JavaScript includes a table that tells 
    us that the order of the arithmetic operator used in the expression above is 
    as follows:

    ** > (* and /) > +

  - This means that when using parentheses for grouping, the expression is equivalent to 
    (4 * 5) + ((3 ** 2) / 10), and therefore evaluates to 20.9.


  Discussion:
  - Although operator precedence makes an expression like 4 * 5 + 3 ** 2 / 10 unambiguous 
    for the JavaScript engine, using parentheses usually makes an expression with multiple 
    operators much easier for humans to read. 
  - For clarity, you should always use the parentheses when mixing operators, e.g.,

  (4 * 5) + ((3 ** 2) / 10)

  - Don't assume that somebody working on your code knows the precise precedence rules.
