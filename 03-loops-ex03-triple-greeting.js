/*
  Triple Greeting

  Write a loop that logs greeting three times.

  let greeting = 'Aloha!';
*/

// using a for loop
let greeting = 'Aloha!';

for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i += 1) {
  console.log(greeting);
}


// using a while loop
let count = 1;

while (count <= 3) {
  console.log(greeting);
  count += 1;
}

/*
  Solution:
  - Using a for loop:
    let greeting = 'Aloha!';

    for (let count = 1; count <= 3; count += 1) {
      console.log(greeting);
    }

  - Using a while loop:
    let greeting = 'Aloha!';
    let count = 1;

    while (count <= 3) {
      console.log(greeting);
      count += 1;
    }


  Discussion:
  - For both kinds of loops, we declare a counter variable count to keep track 
    of how many iterations we've been through. 
  - We start by assigning it to 1, and then increment it on each iteration of the 
    loop.
  - As soon as it is greater than 3, the condition provided to the loop returns
    false and the loop is terminated.
