/*
  Yes? No? Part 2

  Take your code from the previous exercise and rewrite the conditional so that 
  it uses the ternary if-then-else operator.
*/

let randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random());
console.log(randomNumber);

// ternary operator
console.log(randomNumber ? 'Yes' : 'No');


/*
  Solution:
  let randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random());

  console.log(randomNumber ? 'Yes!' : 'No.');


  Discussion:
  - The syntactical structure of the ternary operator is like so:

      condition ? expression1 : expression2

  - If the condition provided is truthy, expression1 will be evaluated. 
  - If the condition is falsy, expression2 will be evaluated. 

  - You may have come up with a solution like the following:

    randomNumber ? console.log('Yes!') : console.log('No.');

  - This is a perfectly fine solution. 
  - Ours is an alternative that uses the ternary operator only to decide on 
    the string that is going to be logged. 
  - Take a close look at it: The expression randomNumber ? 'Yes!' : 'No.' 
    evaluates to either the string 'Yes!' or the string 'No.'. 
  - Since it is an expression that evaluates to a string value, we can use it 
    as an argument to console.log. 
  - It's similar to using other complex expressions with operators, as in 
    console.log('Hello' + 'World').
