/*
  Countdown

  The code below logs the numbers from 1 to 10. 

  Change it, so that it instead logs the numbers from 10 to 1 in decreasing order, 
  and then logs 'Launch!'.

  for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i += 1) {
    console.log(i);
  }

*/

for (let i = 10; i >= 1; i -= 1) {
  console.log(i);
}

console.log('Launch!');

/*
  Solution:
  for (let i = 10; i > 0; i -= 1) {
    console.log(i);
  }

  console.log('Launch!');

  This code logs:
  10
  9
  8
  7
  6
  5
  4
  3
  2
  1
  Launch!

  Discussion:
  - In our solution code, we initialize i to 10, and decrement i by 1 on each 
    iteration, using the short-hand expression i -= 1. 
  - Once i is equal to 0, the condition provided to our for loop is false and the 
    loop terminates. 
  - Finally, we log 'Launch!'.

  - There are different ways to achieve this behavior. For example, you could also 
    use i >= 0 as condition and then check whether i reached the value of 0 
    inside the loop, in order to determine whether to log the number or 'Launch!':

    for (let i = 10; i >= 0; i -= 1) {
      if (i === 0) {
        console.log('Launch!');
      } else {
        console.log(i);
      }
    }
