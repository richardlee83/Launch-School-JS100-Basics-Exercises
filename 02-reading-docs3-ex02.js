/*
  Without looking into your notes, try to remember which primitive data types are 
  defined in JavaScript. 

  Then find this information on MDN.

  Answer:
  Primitive Data Types:
  - String
  - Number
  - Boolean
  - Null
  - Undefined
  - BigInt
  - Symbol
*/

/*
  Solution:
  There are seven primitive data types:
    Number
    BigInt
    Boolean
    String
    Symbol
    null
    Undefined

  - Note that Symbol was added only in ES6, and BigInt was introduced in ES9. 
  - We do not discuss either type in this course.
  - You may see occasional references to null being an object, even on MDN. 
  - But, even there, you will also find statements that say it is primitive type. 
  - The history and behavior of null is somewhat confusing, but, for our purposes, 
    it is a primitive type.


  Discussion:
  - You can find this information on the JavaScript data types and data structures page.

  - In addition to the primitive data types, JavaScript has one non-primitive type: Object 
    (which also comprises arrays). 
  - The main difference is that values of a primitive type are immutable. 
  - That is, there is no way to change values like 47, 'Launch School', or true, while you can 
    change non-primitive values like arrays, e.g. by adding or removing elements.
